    <p>It is super easy to make authentic Japanese miso soup at home! </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>Most Japanese meals are served with a small bowl of steamed rice and a traditional 
        Japanese soup called <strong>Soup (味噌汁).</strong>  At its most basic, miso soup is simply made of <b>3 components:</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li><em>Dashi</em> (Japanese soup stock)</li>
        <li><em>Miso</em>Soybean paste</li>
        <li>Soup ingredients, such as tofu and wakame seaweed</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Make Dashi (Japanese Soup Stock)</li>
        <img src="dashi.jpg" alt="dashi">
        <p>To make authentic Japanese miso soup, you will have to use dashi as the 
            soup broth and not any other types of broth. Miso soup is not miso soup without dashi.</p>
        <li>Add Miso paste</li>
        <img src="miso-paste.jpg" alt="Miso ">
        <p>Miso (味噌), <em>fermented soybean paste,</em> is made from soybeans, grains (steamed rice or barley), salt, and koji culture (麹, a fermentation starter).</p>
        <li>Add tofu</li>
        <img src="tofu.jpeg" alt="tofu">
        <p>Tofu is edible (and delicious) out of the package <em>(try Chilled Tofu and Tofu Salad recipes)</em> and does not require cooking. You just need to reheat it.</p>
